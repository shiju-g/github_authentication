# Project Details

This project is built using the following technologies: React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux
Toolkit, and NextAuth. It provides a seamless user experience by integrating GitHub
authentication with NextAuth. Simply click the sign-in button to authenticate with GitHub.

Once signed in, you'll be greeted with a message displaying "Your dashboard is ready!" and a
prompt to visit it. The dashboard page allows you to view your profile information, including
your profile image, name, ID, follower count, and details on your repositories such as the total
count of repositories, public repositories, and private repositories.

Additionally, you have the convenience of searching through your repositories right from the
dashboard. The page design is beautifully crafted using Tailwind CSS, ensuring an appealing
and intuitive user interface.

For secure authentication, an API has been created using Next.js to handle the
authentication process. Redux Toolkit is employed for efficient state management throughout the application.

I recently updated my project to use the GitHub API to fetch trending repositories. I then set the trending repositories in the Redux store and rendered them on the trending repository page in the dashboard. I have attached a screenshot below.

Feel free to explore the codebase and make it your own. Enjoy!
